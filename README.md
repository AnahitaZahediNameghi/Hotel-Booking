# Hotel-Booking
Data Analysis Through Pythonic Visualization Tools)
In this mini-project, I explore various data analysis questions using visualization techniques provided by popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The project 
demonstrates how effective visualizations can help extract insights from data, making complex patterns more comprehensible.
Besides, I also created a web app through streamlit and you can access it via the following link: https://hotel-booking-jxkliq6pzncwappidmgjctr.streamlit.app/
